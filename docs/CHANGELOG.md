# Changelog

All notable changes to KwikPaste are documented here.

## 1.3.0 - 2026-09-24

- Added a Storage Limit setting, 1 GB by default. The storage meter in the sidebar fills at this size. Going over it only shows a reminder by default; switch to Auto clean to delete the oldest regular records until usage is back under the limit. Favorites and pinned records are always kept.
- Moved Clear Records from the clipboard window's more-actions menu into the Storage Locations settings.
- Trimmed the tray menu to Preference and Exit, and removed the version number from the tray tooltip.
- Update checks now use the system proxy, query every enabled channel at the same time, and time out instead of hanging when a server can't be reached.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-09-23

- Turned on in-app updates. Update packages are signed with the KwikPaste key and verified before installing, and downloads come from a mainland China CDN with GitHub as the fallback.
- Automatic update checks are now on by default, including beta and nightly builds. When several channels are enabled, KwikPaste installs whichever one offers the newest version.
- Unified window materials and appearance controls, using native materials where the system supports them and falling back where it doesn't.
- Turned the hover preview into a native-material panel window.
- Load image thumbnails on demand, with same-size placeholders while they load.
- Stopped the hover preview from redoing window setup and data loading on every hover frame.
- Avoided redundant database reads and full-text index rewrites.
- Fixed hover preview panel positioning and opacity.
- Named the app and installers KwikPaste on both Windows and macOS.
- Removed the first-run legacy data import step.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-09-16

- Established the Chinese product name **快贴** and the English technical name **KwikPaste**.
- Changed the application identifier to `com.fastthree.kwikpaste`.
- Replaced application, installer, favicon, and tray artwork with the KwikPaste K mark.
- Added `.kwikpastebak` backup packages and isolated `KwikPasteData` storage.
- Disabled the inherited updater until FastThree signing and release infrastructure are ready.
- Removed the inherited sponsor QR entry and redirected the project link to `https://paste.fastthree.com`.
